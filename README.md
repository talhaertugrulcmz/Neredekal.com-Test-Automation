### Writing the implementations

This is where the java implementation of the steps would be implemented. Since this is a Selenium based project, the java implementation would invoke Selenium APIs as required.

_We recommend considering modelling your tests using the [Page Object](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/PageObjects) pattern, and the [Webdriver support](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/PageFactory) for creating them._

- Note that every Gauge step implementation is annotated with a `Step` attribute that takes the Step text pattern as a parameter.
